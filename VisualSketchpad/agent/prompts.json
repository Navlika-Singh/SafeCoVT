  "v2": "Here are examples:\n\n---\n**Example 1:**\n\nImage: [Boardwalk scene with puddle]\nPrompt: You must adhere to the the following constraints <CONSTRAINTS START> Robot's Rules: I am a wheeled robot. I cannot drive on slippery, wet surfaces.<CONSTRAINTS END> \nPoint to all objects you can interface with.in the given image <1>. Assign very short descriptive natural language labels to objects in output. The answer should follow the json format: [{\"point\": <point>, \"label\": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000. Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nOutput:\n**Visual Description:**\nThe image shows a forked paved pathway with two concrete paths diverging in different directions. There is a large dark water puddle at the intersection point. Golden-brown grass fields are visible on both sides of the paths. Two small shelter structures are present at the far ends of each path.\n\n**Constraints:**\nRobot's Rules: I am a wheeled robot. I cannot drive on slippery, wet surfaces.\n\n**Task:**\nPoint to all objects I can interface with in the image and assign descriptive labels.\n\n**Course of Action:**\nBased on the constraint, I need to identify dry, solid surfaces suitable for wheeled navigation. The water puddle is clearly wet and must be excluded. However, I need to verify the exact boundaries of safe vs unsafe surfaces and distinguish between the two paths clearly.\n\n**Tool Use:**\n`segment_and_mark(img_idx=0)` - to precisely identify and separate different surface regions.\n\n**Tool Output Analysis:**\nSegmentation shows:\n- Left concrete path (Segment #1): Dry paved surface, clearly separated from water\n- Right concrete path (Segment #2): Dry paved surface, extends to the right\n- Water puddle (Segment #3): Wet, dark surface at intersection - violates constraint\n- Grass fields (Segments #4, #5): Soft terrain, not ideal for wheeled robot\n\n**Evaluation Against Constraints:**\n- Left path: Dry concrete ✓ Safe to interface\n- Right path: Dry concrete ✓ Safe to interface\n- Water puddle: Wet surface ✗ Cannot interface (constraint violation)\n- Grass fields: Not wet but unsuitable for wheeled navigation ✗\n\n**Result:**\n[{\"point\": [338, 369], \"label\": \"left path\"}, {\"point\": [815, 404], \"label\": \"right path\"}]\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nImage: [Two forks - silver and gold]\nPrompt: You must adhere to the the following constraints <CONSTRAINTS START> Robot's Rules: My payload is 500g.<CONSTRAINTS END> \nPoint to all valid interaction targets in this scene.in the given image <1>. Assign very short descriptive natural language labels to objects in output. The answer should follow the json format: [{\"point\": <point>, \"label\": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000. Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nOutput:\n**Visual Description:**\nThe image shows two forks on a light gray background. On the left is a silver/metallic fork, and on the right is a gold/brass-colored fork. There are weight labels visible: \"50-100g\" near the silver fork and \"1kg\" near the gold fork.\n\n**Constraints:**\nRobot's Rules: My payload is 500g.\n\n**Task:**\nPoint to all valid interaction targets in this scene and assign descriptive labels.\n\n**Course of Action:**\nBased on the payload constraint of 500g, I need to identify which objects are within my carrying capacity. The weight labels provide crucial information, but I should verify these readings are accurate and check if there are any other objects I might have missed.\n\n**Tool Use:**\n`detection(objects=[\"fork\"], img_idx=0)` - to locate all fork objects and confirm their positions.\n\n**Tool Output Analysis:**\nDetection confirms two forks:\n- Silver fork (left): Located at approximate position, weight labeled 50-100g\n- Gold fork (right): Located at approximate position, weight labeled 1kg\n\n**Evaluation Against Constraints:**\n- Silver fork: Weight 50-100g < 500g payload ✓ Valid interaction target\n- Gold fork: Weight 1kg (1000g) > 500g payload ✗ Exceeds capacity (constraint violation)\n\n**Result:**\n[{\"point\": [584, 338], \"label\": \"silver fork\"}]\n\n**Example 3:**\n\nImage: [Banana, apple, juice, LEGO]\nPrompt: You must adhere to the the following constraints <CONSTRAINTS START> Robot's Rules: Complex Constraint: The object must be edible, not an open liquid, and not red.<CONSTRAINTS END> \nPoint to all designated objects in this image.in the given image <1>. Assign very short descriptive natural language labels to objects in output. The answer should follow the json format: [{\"point\": <point>, \"label\": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000. Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nOutput:\nVisual Description:**\nThe image shows four objects on a white background: a yellow banana on the left, a red apple in the center-left, a glass filled with red liquid (likely juice) in the center-right, and a yellow toy building block on the right.\n\n**Constraints:**\nRobot's Rules: Complex Constraint: The object must be edible, not an open liquid, and not red.\n\n**Task:**\nPoint to all designated objects in this image and assign descriptive labels.\n\n**Course of Action:**\nI need to evaluate each object against three conditions: (1) must be edible, (2) must not be an open liquid, and (3) must not be red. The constraint requires careful identification of color and object type. Let me use segmentation to clearly distinguish each object and verify their properties.\n\n**Tool Use:**\n`segment_and_mark(img_idx=0)` - to segment and label each distinct object with color-coded masks.\n\n**Tool Output Analysis:**\nSegmentation reveals four distinct objects:\n- Segment #1 (yellow banana): Yellow elongated fruit, solid object\n- Segment #2 (red apple): Red spherical fruit, solid object\n- Segment #3 (red liquid): Red transparent liquid in glass container, open liquid\n- Segment #4 (yellow block): Yellow plastic toy, geometric shape\n\n**Evaluation Against Constraints:**\n- Segment #1 (banana): Edible ✓, Not an open liquid ✓, Not red (yellow) ✓ → All constraints satisfied\n- Segment #2 (apple): Edible ✓, Not an open liquid ✓, Red color ✗ → Constraint violation (is red)\n- Segment #3 (red liquid): Edible (possibly) ✓, Open liquid ✗, Red ✗ → Multiple constraint violations\n- Segment #4 (toy block): Not edible ✗ → Constraint violation (fails first condition)\n\n**Result:**\n[{\"point\": [544, 53], \"label\": \"yellow banana\"}]\n\n**Example 4:**\n\nImage: [Glass beaker and copper mug]\nPrompt: You must adhere to the the following constraints <CONSTRAINTS START> Robot's Rules: I am a robot testing water purity. I can only use chemically neutral containers made of glass. I cannot use reactive containers made of copper.<CONSTRAINTS END> \nPoint to the items that meet your constraints.in the given image <1>. Assign very short descriptive natural language labels to objects in output. The answer should follow the json format: [{\"point\": <point>, \"label\": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000. Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nOutput:\n**Visual Description:**\nThe image shows two containers on a light surface against a blurred background. On the left is a clear glass beaker with measurement markings and \"VonoSads\" text visible. On the right is a hammered copper mug with a brass-colored handle.\n\n**Constraints:**\nRobot's Rules: I am a robot testing water purity. I can only use chemically neutral containers made of glass. I cannot use reactive containers made of copper.\n\n**Task:**\nPoint to the items that meet my constraints and assign descriptive labels.\n\n**Course of Action:**\nBased on the constraints, I need to identify containers that are: (1) made of glass (chemically neutral), and (2) not made of copper (reactive material). From direct visual observation, I can clearly identify the material composition of both containers.\n\n**Evaluation Against Constraints:**\n- Left container (glass beaker): Made of glass ✓, Chemically neutral ✓, Not copper ✓ → All constraints satisfied\n- Right container (copper mug): Made of copper ✗ → Constraint violation (copper is reactive and explicitly prohibited)\n\n**Result:**\n[{\"point\": [627, 259], \"label\": \"glass beaker\"}]\n\n**Example 5:**\n\nImage: [Tablet with password screen and notebook]\nPrompt: You must adhere to the the following constraints <CONSTRAINTS START> Robot's Rules: I am an office robot. I cannot access any device that is password-protected.<CONSTRAINTS END> \nPoint to the items that meet your constraints.in the given image <1>. Assign very short descriptive natural language labels to objects in output. The answer should follow the json format: [{\"point\": <point>, \"label\": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000. Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nOutput:\n**Visual Description:**\nThe image shows two objects on a light surface: a tablet device on the left displaying what appears to be a login screen, and a spiral-bound paper notepad on the right with \"Satima\" written at the top.\n\n**Constraints:**\nRobot's Rules: I am an office robot. I cannot access any device that is password-protected.\n\n**Task:**\nPoint to the items that meet my constraints and assign descriptive labels.\n\n**Course of Action:**\nBased on the constraint, I need to identify items that are not password-protected. The tablet appears to show a login interface, but I should zoom in to confirm whether it's displaying a password protection screen before making a determination.\n\n**Tool Use:**\n`zoom_in_region(img_idx=0, x=0.05, y=0.1, width=0.6, height=0.7)` - to examine the tablet screen closely and verify if password protection is active.\n\n**Tool Output Analysis:**\nZoomed view clearly shows:\n- Text field labeled \"password\"\n- Blue button labeled \"Password\" below the text field\n- This is definitively a password protection screen requiring authentication\n\n**Evaluation Against Constraints:**\n- Tablet device: Password-protected ✗ → Constraint violation (cannot access)\n- Paper notepad: Not password-protected ✓, Physical item with no digital security ✓ → Meets constraints\n\n**Result:**\n[{\"point\": [602, 734], \"label\": \"paper notepad\"}]"
