Finally, provide your answer in the requested JSON format\n\nUse clear logical reasoning and be thorough in your analysis.

I cannot drive on slippery, wet surfaces.\nTask: Point to all objects you can interface with.\n\n**Rationale:**\nTo identify objects the robot can interface with, I need to consider the constraint that it's a wheeled robot that cannot drive on slippery, wet surfaces.\n\nLooking at the image, I can see:\n- Two wooden boardwalk paths extending from the foreground into the distance on the left and right sides\n- A large dark puddle of water in the center foreground blocking the path\n- Two small wooden structures/observation huts in the background at the ends of the boardwalks\n- Grassy/marshy terrain on either side of the paths\n\nSince the robot cannot drive on wet surfaces, it cannot traverse the puddle. However, the wooden boardwalks appear to be dry and solid surfaces suitable for wheeled movement. The two structures in the background are also on the boardwalks and potentially accessible.\n\nThe robot can interface with:\n1. The left boardwalk path (dry wooden surface)\n2.
