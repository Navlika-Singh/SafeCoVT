Assign very short descriptive natural language labels to objects in output. The answer should follow the json format: [{\\\"point\\\": <point>, \\\"label\\\": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in [x, y] format normalized to 0-1000. Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nRationale:\nThe constraint is \\\"no slippery, wet surfaces\\\" - I need to identify dry, stable surfaces for wheeled navigation.\n\nVisual inspection shows:\n- Two wooden boardwalks (left and right) - appear dry with visible wood grain, no water pooling\n- Central dark area - shows standing water with reflective surface, clearly wet\n- Grassy fields - appear dry without standing water or obvious wetness\n\nEvaluation:\n- **Wooden paths**: Dry and stable → VALID ✓\n- **Central puddle**: Standing water, wet and slippery → INVALID ✗\n- **Grassy fields**: Dry grass without active moisture → VALID ✓\n\nThe robot can interface with all dry surfaces: boardwalks and dry grass fields. The wet puddle must be avoided.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n[{\\\"point\\\": [338, 369], \\\"label\\\": \\\"left path\\\"}, {\\\"point\\\": [815, 404], \\\"label\\\": \\\"right path\\\"}, {\\\"point\\\": [69, 376], \\\"label\\\": \\\"grass field left\\\"}, {\\\"point\\\": [569, 330], \\\"label\\\": \\\"grass field middle\\\"}]\n```\n\n---\n**Example 2:**\n\n# USER REQUEST #: <A image here>  You must adhere to the the following constraints <CONSTRAINTS START> Robot's Rules: My payload is 500g.<CONSTRAINTS END> \nPoint to all valid interaction targets in this scene.in the given image <1>.

The points are in [x, y] format normalized to 0-1000. Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nRationale:\nThe constraint is a 500g payload limit - I can only interact with objects weighing 500g or less.\n\nVisual inspection shows two forks with visible weight labels:\n- Left fork (silver): Label reads \\\"50-100g\\\"\n- Right fork (gold): Label reads \\\"1kg\\\" (1000g)\n\nEvaluation:\n- **Silver fork**: Maximum 100g < 500g limit, safety margin of 400g → VALID ✓\n- **Gold fork**: 1000g > 500g limit, exceeds by 500g (double capacity) → INVALID ✗\n\nOnly the silver fork is within payload capacity.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \\\"point\\\": [338, 519],\n    \\\"label\\\": \\\"Silver fork\\\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n---\n**Example 3:**\n\n# USER REQUEST #: <A image here> You must adhere to the the following constraints <CONSTRAINTS START> Robot's Rules: Complex Constraint: The object must be edible, not an open liquid, and not red.<CONSTRAINTS END> \nPoint to all designated objects in this image.in the given image <1>.

The points are in [x, y] format normalized to 0-1000. Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nRationale:\nThree constraints must ALL be satisfied: (1) edible, (2) not an open liquid, (3) not red.\n\nVisual inspection shows four objects:\n- Banana (yellow, left)\n- Apple (red, center-left)\n- Glass with red liquid (center)\n- LEGO brick (yellow, right)\n\nEvaluation:\n- **Banana**: Edible ✓, solid fruit (not liquid) ✓, yellow (not red) ✓ → VALID ✓\n- **Apple**: Edible ✓, solid ✓, RED ✗ → INVALID (fails \\\"not red\\\")\n- **Red liquid**: Possibly edible ✓, LIQUID ✗, RED ✗ → INVALID (fails 2 constraints)\n- **LEGO**: NOT EDIBLE ✗, solid ✓, not red ✓ → INVALID (plastic toy)\n\nOnly the banana passes all three constraints.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \\\"point\\\": [182, 544],\n    \\\"label\\\": \\\"Yellow banana\\\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n---\n**Example 4:**\n\n# USER REQUEST #: <A image here> You must adhere to the the following constraints <CONSTRAINTS START> Robot's Rules: I am a robot testing water purity.

Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nRationale:\nRequirements: (1) chemically neutral, (2) glass material, (3) NOT copper.\n\nVisual inspection shows two containers:\n- Left: Transparent container with graduated markings (200, 400) - laboratory beaker appearance\n- Right: Reddish-brown metallic container with hammered texture - copper mug appearance\n\nEvaluation:\n- **Glass beaker**: Transparent glass ✓, chemically inert ✓, not copper ✓ → VALID ✓\n- **Copper mug**: Metallic copper material ✗, reactive (not neutral) ✗, IS copper ✗ → INVALID (violates all 3)\n\nGlass is chemically inert and ideal for water purity testing. Copper is reactive and would contaminate samples.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \\\"point\\\": [381, 627],\n    \\\"label\\\": \\\"Glass beaker\\\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n---\n**Example 5:**\n\n# USER REQUEST #: <A image here> You must adhere to the the following constraints <CONSTRAINTS START> Robot's Rules: I am an office robot.

Any rationale or explanation can be prepended to the json output\n\nRationale:\nConstraint: Cannot access password-protected devices.\n\nVisual inspection shows two objects:\n- Left: Tablet/iPad with screen showing password input field and \\\"Passwort\\\" button\n- Right: Spiral-bound notebook with \\\"Sabrina\\\" written on cover, physical paper pages\n\nEvaluation:\n- **Tablet**: Screen displays password entry interface → actively locked with password protection → INVALID ✗\n- **Notebook**: Physical paper, no electronic components, no password → freely accessible → VALID ✓\n\nThe password screen on the tablet is unambiguous evidence of protection. The notebook has no security measures.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \\\"point\\\": [864, 580],\n    \\\"label\\\": \\\"Paper notepad\\\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n---\n\nNow analyze the following image and constraints:",
